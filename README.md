# RCDataManagement

This repository contains several scripts for downloading, installing, and using data management tools on the Princeton Research Computing (RC) systems. Included are:

- Download and installation scripts for:
  - md5deep: a parallel checksumming tool that uses the md5sum checksum algorithm
  - pixz: parallel compression tool that speeds up compression and decompression using the XZ compression algorithm
  - veritar: an archive verification tool that uses the md5sum checksum algorithm to check that the contents of a tar.xz archive are consistent with a list of checksums
 
- Test
